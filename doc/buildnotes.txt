[Win32]

For building the library under Windows, the project is set up
as a HIDE 1.23+ project.
 
[linux]

For building with linux, change directory to the hidelib folder
and use the bash 'source' command to launch
the script 'linuxbuild_hla'.

Final output will be 'hidelib.a'

------------------------------------------

[For Win32 and linux]

If you have HIDE, the headers are already located in the
hlalib/hide folder

To include all the headers, use:

#include ("hide/hidelib.hhf")

Otherwise, all the headers may also be found in the src folder.
Copy these to your hlainc path.
